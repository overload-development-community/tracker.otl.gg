## Running Locally

To run this locally, you need to be a running a Microsoft SQL Server instance.  You also need to do two things.  First, create a settings.js in the root of the project.

Here is a minimal settings.js file, but you will need to modify the SQL Server information.  Ignore the redis and logger sections, that can remain disabled for local development.

```
module.exports = {
    express: {
        port: 53535
    },
    database: {
        server: "your.sql.server.address",
        port: 1433,
        user: "web_oltracker",
        password: "secure_password",
        database: "oltrackertest",
        pool: {
            max: 50,
            min: 0,
            idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
        },
        options: {
            trustServerCertificate: true
        }
    },
    redis: {
        host: "",
        port: 6379,
        password: ""
    },
    redisPrefix: "",
    disableRedis: true,
    htmlMinifier: {
        collapseBooleanAttributes: true,
        collapseWhitespace: true,
        conservativeCollapse: true,
        decodeEntities: true,
        html5: true,
        removeAttributeQuotes: true,
        removeComments: true,
        removeEmptyAttributes: true,
        removeOptionalTags: true,
        removeRedundantAttributes: true,
        useShortDoctype: true
    },
    logger: {
        key: "",
        url: ""
    },
    disableLogger: true,
    minify: {
        enabled: true,
        cache: false
    }
};
```

Second, your SQL server will need the tables required for the tracker to store its information.  Here is a script to run to create those tables.  You will need to create the `web_oltracker` user through the UI.

```
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[tblCompleted](
    [CompletedId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [IPAddress] [varchar](15) NOT NULL,
    [Data] [text] NOT NULL,
    [CrDate] [datetime] NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
    [CompletedId] ASC
)WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]
GO

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[tblCompleted] ADD  DEFAULT (getutcdate()) FOR [CrDate]
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[tblServers](
    [ServerId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [IPAddress] [varchar](15) NOT NULL,
    [Visible] [bit] NOT NULL,
    [Data] [text] NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
(
    [ServerId] ASC
)WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]
GO

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[tblServers] ADD  DEFAULT ((1)) FOR [Visible]
GO
```
